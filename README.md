# IntlContacts

This is just a sandbox app for a personal task I had â€” to add the `+1` country-code prefix to all US numbers that were missing the country code.

This is not production battle-tested, though it works well on my own diverse contact book of ~1000 phone numbers. It is idempotent and preserves phone number formatting.
